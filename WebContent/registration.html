				<p>Thank you for your participation in the hoozon.tv + WKYT pilot program scheduled for April 22 - May 5.
				<h2>Info about pilot</h2>
				<p class="faqheader">What is hoozon.tv?</p>
				<p>hoozon.tv is an automated social media alerting system for local TV news. In short, it watches your channel, looks for your face and when it sees you, 
				tweets and/or facebooks the image on your behalf along with a link to the station's live streaming video feed. The hope is that this consistent, automated social 
				strategy will drive people to the broadcast and live feed, boosting traffic.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">What is this page?</p>
				<p>In order for hoozon.tv to be able to tweet/facebook on your behalf, you have to link your social accounts to hoozon.tv. This page allows you to do that.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">My Twitter account is listed, but it's my personal account. What should I do?</p>
				<p>Create an account for your TV persona and then let me know what the twitter handle is.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">Should I link my personal Twitter or Facebook accounts?</p>
				<p>No. Only link your WKYT accounts.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">How often will alerts go out?</p>
				<p>Once an alert fires, another alert will not fire for 2 hours. This means that if you appear at 4pm, the earliest another alert will go out is 6pm.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">You've sent an alert with a picture that's not me. What should I do?</p>
				<p>Delete it. Our system will do its best to biometrically choose the correct person every time and has performed nearly flawlessly in internal tests. 
				However, it is possible that an incorrect alert	will go out during the pilot. If that happens, just delete it and let us know. We apologize in advance 
				if this happens to you.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">I don't like the picture you tweeted/facebooked, can I delete it?</p>
				<p>Sure.</p>
				<p class="faqheader">I see that my account is automatically retweeting and/or liking the facebook posts of other reporters. What's the deal?</p>
				<p>Occasionally, we may use your account to retweet one of your fellow reporters' tweets in order to reach a broader audience. 
				We may also "like" other reporters' facebook posts to get higher ranking in the facebook news feed. 
				As far as retweeting, the system will only do this if it hasn't seen you in a while and will be kept to a minimum.
				</p>
				<h2>Tips for best results</h2>
				<p>hoozon.tv's biometric face recognition system is somewhat sensitive to changes in your appearance. For best results follow these rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Avoid harsh light & dark shadows on your face. *** most important ***</li>
					<li>Avoid facial obstructions such as glasses or hair that blows in your face.</li>
					<li>Avoid camera lens distortion due to rain, dirt, snow, etc.</li>
					<li>Don't squint.</li>
				</ul>
